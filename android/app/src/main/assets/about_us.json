We provide these children a home environment.\n\"CHILD\" brings about a social-transformation in the lives of young children who have been orphaned and ostracized for no fault of theirs. These children come from very poor socio-economic backgrounds in which they’ve either lost their parents to HIV/AIDS or are the abandoned children of commercial sex workers or destitute women. CHILD is bringing them to average living of these young children, by providing them with an environment conducive to holistic growth and development.\nA key facet of CHILD is to provide an upbringing for our children that will ensure to become exceptional global citizens with great values and also integrate seamlessly into the mainstream society.\nFurthermore, they are living in a family setting that makes them realize the family values and enables them to develop trust among one another"
